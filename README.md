# Dice
This C++ code allows you to recreate a dice game on your computer.
When you launch the program, a terminal opens up with six possible actions. They are activated when you select a number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0) and enter it with Enter.
   1: You enter the number of dice thrown.
   2: You manually add points.
   3: You are viewing all the results that have been drawn.
   4: You are number one.
   5: You delete all the results that have fallen.
   0: You exit the program.
